# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why can't I flash my keyboard from within WSL?

Currently a limitation of WSL. The recommendation is to use [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) to work round the issue.

## How can I access my firmware files?

Within the WSL shell, you can run the following command to start browsing

```console
wstart ~/qmk_firmware
```
